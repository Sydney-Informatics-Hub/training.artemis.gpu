**Synopsis:** Introduces GPU computing, and running GPU jobs on Artemis and other HPC systmes. The University of Sydney's Artemis HPC hosts several NVIDIA V100 GPUs. This course will help you to understand basic concepts of GPU programming. You will learn fundamentals of basic CUDA code, and write and run examples using C/CUDA, Matlab, and Python. You will undertake practical applications in Deep Learning using Python, Tensorflow, and Keras. You will learn how to set up suitable environemnts on Artemis for GPU-enabled applications to run, and how to run and submit jobs on the Artemis HPC GPU queue.

**Target audience:** Students and staff who would like to learn how to use GPU enabled code, especially for Artemis HPC. Participants must have a valid USyd unikey.

**Follow-on courses:** This course is **part** of the **[Artemis HPC Training Series]({{ site.series_home }})**.

**Acknoledgment ensures the continuation of our services**:e.g. *This research was supported by the University of Sydneyâ€™s, Core Research Facility, Sydney Informatics Hub training program.*

Most topics covered here have extra detail in the [Artemis guide, get it here](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/overview).

> ## Prerequisites
> Competency on the Unix/Linux command line:
>
> * If you are interested in getting started in most computing environments but have no Unix/Linux command-line skills, you should first take an [Introduction to Unix/Linux](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/unix) course.
